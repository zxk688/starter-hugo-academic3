summary: Superresolution (SR) of remote sensing images aims to restore
  high-quality information from low-resolution images. Recently, it has
  witnessed great strides with the rapid development of deep learning (DL)
  techniques. Despite their good performance, these DL-based models are often
  ineffective in balancing global and local feature extraction. Moreover, they
  are usually hindered by the poor image reconstruction capability of the
  decoder inside their SR models. To cope with this problem, this work proposes
  a novel global context-driven residual dense network (GCRDN) for satellite
  image SR based on the encoder and decoder architecture. In particular, the
  proposed encoder is endowed with nonlocal sparse attention modules
  incorporated into the residual dense network to learn robust representations
  from global features. Furthermore, a decoder equipped with back-sampling
  blocks is devised to fully exploit the feature maps extracted from the
  encoder. Extensive experimental comparisons based on two multisensor satellite
  remote sensing datasets confirm that the proposed GCRDN achieves impressive
  performance in terms of perceptual quality and fidelity.
