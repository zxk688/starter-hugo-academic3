slides: Weakly supervised learning using image-level annotations has become a
  popular choice for reducing labeling efforts of remote sensing object
  extraction. Existing methods exploit inter-pixel relations within an
  individual image patch for object localizations. When facing large-scale
  remote sensing images, it is still challenging to obtain global semantic
  contexts across image patches for feature representation, resulting in
  inaccurate object localizations. To remedy these issues, we propose a
  local-global anchor guidance network (LGAGNet) for weakly supervised landslide
  extraction. Specifically, a structure-aware object locating (SOL) module is
  developed to capture the spatial structure of landslide objects and extract
  local category anchors containing informative feature embeddings. Furthermore,
  we leverage a global anchor aggregation (GAA) module to excavate semantic
  patterns across image patches based on a memory bank, which is then used as
  additional context cues to enhance the feature presentation through a
  cross-attention mechanism. Finally, a hybrid loss function is designed to
  guide the network training, considering category-aware semantic contrasts and
  local activation consistency. Experimental results on high-resolution aerial
  and satellite image datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach
  on landslide extraction.
