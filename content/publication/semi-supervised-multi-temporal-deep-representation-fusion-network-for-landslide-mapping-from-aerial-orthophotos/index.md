slides: Using remote sensing techniques to monitor landslides and their
  resultant land cover changes is fundamentally important for risk assessment
  and hazard prevention. Despite enormous efforts in developing intelligent
  landslide mapping (LM) approaches, LM remains challenging owing to high
  spectral heterogeneity of very-high-resolution (VHR) images and the daunting
  labeling efforts. To this end, a deep learning model based on semi-supervised
  multi-temporal deep representation fusion network, namely SMDRF-Net, is
  proposed for reliable and efficient LM. In comparison with previous methods,
  the SMDRF-Net possesses three distinct properties. (1) Unsupervised deep
  representation learning at the pixel- and object-level is performed by
  transfer learning using the Wasserstein generative adversarial network with
  gradient penalty to learn discriminative deep features and retain precise
  outlines of landslide objects in the high-level feature space. (2)
  Attention-based adaptive fusion of multi-temporal and multi-level deep
  representations is developed to exploit the spatio-temporal dependencies of
  deep representations and enhance the feature representation capability of the
  network. (3) The network is optimized using limited samples with pseudo-labels
  that are automatically generated based on a comprehensive uncertainty index.
  Experimental results from the analysis of VHR aerial orthophotos demonstrate
  the reliability and robustness of the proposed approach for LM in comparison
  with state-of-the-art methods.
